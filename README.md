# Titanite Upgrades Mod
by Kevin "mrunderhill89" Cameron

SUMMARY:
This mod adds the Titanite material from the Dark Souls series to Minetest.
Unlike most materials, titanite isn't used to forge weapons directly, but to
upgrade existing weapons. Also included in the mod is a procedural upgrade system 
similar to one in Dark Souls, where tools can be gradually improved from +1 to +10.

TITANITE:
Titanite comes in four interchangeable quantities, just like in Dark Souls:
small shards, large shards, chunks, and blocks (based on slabs). 
Each quantity is worth four times the one below it, and you can freely craft between them.

Titanite has the same spawn pattern as Mese crystals, with shard appearing at medium depth,
and whole blocks at very far depths.

UPGRADES:
Upgrading a weapon is as simple as crafting the desired tool with the required quantity of titanite.
Each level requires an increasing amount of titanite, starting with just 1 shard and progressing to
chunks and finally blocks by the time you get to +10. Any tool that uses minetest's default 
tool capabilities can be upgraded, including those added by other mods. Armor from the 3D Armor mod
can also be upgraded, but any special-purpose tools like the screwdriver are left alone. As a happy 
side-effect, upgrading a tool restores its wear value.

TECHNIC IMPROVEMENTS:
If you have the Technic mod and don't want to bother with manual crafting, you can throw your weapons
along with some titanite shards into any alloy furnace. The furnace will automatically take the required
number of shards to upgrade your weapon. Note that this is only a convenience feature, and you aren't
getting or losing anything by using it.

You can also downgrade your weapons with an Extractor. You'll get back half of the material used to
make the upgrade so you can use them on other tools.

WHAT WORKS:
Titanite craftitems and blocks
Weapon upgrades
Armor upgrades
Manual upgrading
Alloy-furnace upgrading
Graphical overlays on upgraded weapons

WHAT STILL NEEDS WORK:
Graphical overlays show up on the wielded weapon (should just be in inventory)
Upgrades for special tools like the screwdriver
Weapon Ascension (Dark Souls' version of enchanting)
